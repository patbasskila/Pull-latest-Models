You tried to access openai.ChatCompletion, but this is no longer supported in openai>=1.0.0 - see the README at https://github.com/openai/openai-python for the API.

You can run `openai migrate` to automatically upgrade your codebase to use the 1.0.0 interface. 

Alternatively, you can pin your installation to the old version, e.g. `pip install openai==0.28`

- [https://github.com/patbasskila/Pull-latest-Models](https://github.com/patbasskila/Pull-latest-Models): The code defines three functions: `download_model`, `is_latest_version_installed`, and `get_latest_release_info`. `download_model` downloads a specified version of a model from a given URL and saves it in a specified directory. `is_latest_version_installed` checks if the latest version of a model is already installed in a specified directory. `get_latest_release_info` retrieves the latest release information of a model from a given URL. All of these functions are designed to work with the Ollama API.
